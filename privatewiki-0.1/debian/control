Description: Simple application to take notes, with encription support
 Privatewiki is a simple application to help you in the way you store
 your notes today.
 .
 Today, you possibly take your notes in paper, plain textfiles all over
 your hard-disk and such. You use them once and send them to the trash,
 so you lose context and relationship they have with previous annotations.
 .
 Privatewiki helps you to store your notes in a simple application, based
 in open standards. Your notes are all added to a single datafile which
 you can carry in a USB pendrive.
 .
 Each document displays in a wiki-style, so you see related concepts and
 you can navigate your annotations easily.
